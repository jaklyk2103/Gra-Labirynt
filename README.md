This repository contains my project from the second year of my studies.
It's a game written in C++ language, using SFML. 

In this game you have to beat randomly generated maze levels in 60 seconds and at the same time fight with enemies and pick up items which change your character's statistics.

To start the game, you have to run MazeRPG.exe in bin folder.

Controls:
Arrow keys - walk
Space - attack
